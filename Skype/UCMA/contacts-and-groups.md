# Contacts and groups


**Applies to**: Skype for Business 2015

A contact is a presentity whose presence information is tracked. A contact registers its status, location, and other attributes with the Skype for Business Server 2015 computer. Contacts can be organized into user-defined groups. In Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 5.0, contacts and groups are supported only by [UserEndpoint](/dotnet/api/microsoft.rtc.collaboration.userendpoint) objects. The [ContactGroupServices](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh383122\(v=office.16\)) property on a **UserEndpoint** instance provides access to a [ContactGroupServices](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh381099\(v=office.16\)) instance, which an application can use to add or remove groups, or update groups by adding or removing contacts. Contacts can be associated with one or more groups. The **ContactGroupServices** class provides methods to subscribe or unsubscribe to a user’s contacts or groups, as well as to refresh the subscription. To update an instance of a contact or a group, an application supplies an existing contact or group instance to the **ContactGroupServices** API, modifies the specific fields of interest, and then publishes the new item.

A contact can be identified by its URI, and a group can be identified by its group ID, which is assigned by Skype for Business Server 2015 when the group is created. An application can use methods on the **ContactGroupServices** class to obtain a contact or group, by using the contact URI or group ID. When an application deletes a group, all of the contacts who belong to the group are updated by the removal of their references to that group.
