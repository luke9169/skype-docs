# PublishAlwaysOnline (QuickStart)

**Applies to**: Skype for Business 2015

**Sample name**: PublishAlwaysOnline

**Sample location**: %ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft UCMA 5.0\\SDK\\Core\\Sample Applications\\QuickStarts\\PublishAlwaysOnline

## Description

Based on the Application ID specified, the sample initializes the platform and any trusted application endpoints corresponding to the provisioned application. Upon establishment, the endpoints publish a static presence of "alwaysonline" by setting the [AutomaticPresencePublicationEnabled](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh381653\(v=office.16\)) property on an [ApplicationEndpointSettings](/dotnet/api/microsoft.rtc.collaboration.applicationendpointsettings?view=ucma-api) object to true. The sample establishes as many application endpoints as have been provisioned on the particular trusted application within the deployment.

For more information about provisioning trusted applications and endpoints in , see [Activating a UCMA 5.0 trusted application](activating-a-ucma-5-0-trusted-application.md) as well as [General application activation](general-application-activation.md) and [Activating a manually-provisioned application](activating-a-manually-provisioned-application.md).

Throughout the lifetime of the process, the sample application listens for the **StateChanged** event on the application endpoint and reflects the endpoint state changes in the console.
