# ConferenceManagement (QuickStart)

**Applies to**: Skype for Business 2015

**Sample name**: ConferenceManagement

**Sample location**: %ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft UCMA 5.0\\SDK\\Core\\Sample Applications\\QuickStarts\\ConferenceManagement

## Description

The application initializes a server platform, four [UserEndpoint](/dotnet/api/microsoft.rtc.collaboration.userendpoint) objects, and one [ApplicationEndpoint](/dotnet/api/microsoft.rtc.collaboration.applicationendpoint) object. The UserEndpoint objects act as the conference organizer and participants. The ApplicationEndpoint endpoint impersonates a phone user in the conference, simulating someone joining from a PSTN gateway. The organizer endpoint schedules an audio/video conference using the conference scheduling APIs, with the following conference scheduling options:

  - Conference access level set to **Invited**. Only participants on the invited list can be admitted.

  - Participant A is in the invited list of the conference.

  - Participants who are not on the invited list are sent to the lobby when they join the conference.

  - Automatic leadership assignment (automatic promotion to leader) is enabled for users from the same company.

  - A participant who joins the conference as a gateway participant bypasses the lobby.

The sample application logic proceeds as follows:

1.  Participant A is invited to the conference and joins the conference successfully. Participant A is automatically promoted to leader.

2.  Participants B and C, who are not in the invited list, join the conference and land in the conference lobby.

3.  Participant A is notified that Participants B and C are in the lobby.

4.  The [ApplicationEndpoint](/dotnet/api/microsoft.rtc.collaboration.applicationendpoint) endpoint, impersonating a phone user, joins the conference successfully as a gateway participant.

5.  The [ApplicationEndpoint](/dotnet/api/microsoft.rtc.collaboration.applicationendpoint) is notified that Participant A is in the conference and Participants B and C are in the conference lobby.

6.  Organizer joins the conference successfully and receives notification that Participants B and C are in the lobby and participants A and phone user are in the conference.

7.  Organizer admits participant B from the lobby and denies access to participant C.

8.  Organizer modifies the conference access level to [SourceNetwork](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh385294\(v=office.16\)).**SameEnterprise** (opens the conference), and then participant C joins the conference successfully.
