# Extending the MediaFlow class

**Applies to**: Skype for Business 2015

The [MediaFlow](/dotnet/api/microsoft.rtc.collaboration.componentmodel.mediaflow?view=ucma-api) abstract class represents a generic flow concept for objects that send or receive media. A nonabstract subclass represents the flow of a specific media type. Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 5.0 provides two **MediaFlow** subclasses: [AudioVideoFlow](/dotnet/api/microsoft.rtc.collaboration.audiovideo.audiovideoflow?view=ucma-api) and [InstantMessagingFlow](/dotnet/api/microsoft.rtc.collaboration.instantmessagingflow?view=ucma-api). These classes represent flows whose media type is, respectively, audio/video and message.

A developer who intends to support a different media type must implement a **MediaFlow** subclass that represents that media type.

None of the methods, properties, and events on the abstract **MediaFlow** class are themselves abstract. As a result, a subclass that inherits from the **MediaFlow** class is not required to provide overriding method, property, or event definitions.
