# PSTN gateway and IP-PBX interoperability

**Applies to**: Skype for Business 2015

For IP-based real-time applications that must communicate with a PSTN network on one side and a unified communications network on the other side, Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 5.0 provides an application the ability to interoperate with SIP PSTN gateways and IP-PBXs with the unified communications network.

The following SIP peers can connect to the UCMA application:

- SIP gateways.
- SIP-enabled IP-PBXs that support the following phones:
    
  - SIP phones  
  - Soft phones that support SIP

SIP peers should support the following protocols:

- SIP—RFC 3261
- DTMF—RFC4733
- SDP—RFC 3264

In addition, SIP peers:

- Must provide media session parameter negotiation (endpoint, codec, and, if applicable, encryption parameters) through SDP, as defined in the SIP and related RFCs and used in SIP.

- Must provide media/audio transport using RTP/RTCP over UDP.

- Must meet the Supported IP Gateways requirements listed in [Telephony Advisor for Exchange 2010](/exchange/voice-mail-unified-messaging/telephone-system-integration-with-um/telephony-advisor-for-exchange-2013).

The following illustration shows a typical setup.
