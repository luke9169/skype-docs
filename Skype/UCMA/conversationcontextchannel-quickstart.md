# ConversationContextChannel (QuickStart)

**Sample name**: ConversationContextChannel

**Sample location**: %ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft UCMA 5.0\\SDK\\Core\\Sample Applications\\QuickStarts\\ConversationContextChannel

## Description

The application initializes the platform to start listening on behalf of a user, accepts the first incoming instant messaging call, and then terminates the call. This is followed by tearing down the conversation, and then the platform. The application prints logging data to the console, and then quits, shutting down the platform normally. Note that the sample does not send a response to the instant message that it receives.
