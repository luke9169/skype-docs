# Contacts and groups management


**Applies to**: Skype for Business 2015

A contact is a unified communication entity that is identified by a SIP URI. One or more contacts can be assembled into logical collections called groups. When a group is created, it is assigned a group ID, which is a server-assigned integer. The Contacts and Groups API in Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 5.0 is available only for [UserEndpoint](/dotnet/api/microsoft.rtc.collaboration.userendpoint) objects.

For more information, see [ContactGroupServices](contactgroupservices.md).
