# Registering your application in Azure AD

>NOTE: We have built a quick registration tool for registering Skype for Busines Trusted Applications in Azure and Skype for Business Online, that eliminates the need to register an Application manually in Azure portal.  You can find the portal at https://aka.ms/skypeappregistration

This article shows you how to register your service application in the Azure Portal at https://portal.azure.com. Before running your service application, you need to register it with Azure Active Directory, even if you are hosting your app outside of Azure. Application registration lets you set the permissions that 
your service applications needs and the sign on and application id URLs used for application authentication.

## Register your application with Azure AD

Sign in to the Classic Azure Management Portal, then do the following:

1. Click the **Azure Active Directory** tab in the left column and select the directory linked to your Skype for Business subscription.

3. Choose name for your application, such as `demosaas`, and select **Web application and/or web API** as its **Type**. The value of **Sign-on URL** is the URL at which your application is hosted.

8. Click **Select permissions** and select required permissions. Click **Done** to complete adding permissions. 
  - **Application permissions**: for accessing Skype for Business Online on behalf of an application. 
  - **Delegated Permissions**:  User scopes: for accessing Skype for Business Online through this application as a user.

If the permissions for Skype for Business do not show in the Azure Management Portal, one likely cause is that the Office 365 account is not associated with the Azure AD.
